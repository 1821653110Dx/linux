# DNS
## append
	append the following to /etc/resolv.conf
		nameserver 8.8.8.8	# recommend

# IP
## check
	current usr
		hostname -I
		OR
		ip addr show
	certain server, such as google
		nslookup   www.google.com
## set
	temporary
		find network card to set ip
			ifconfig -a
		check the card, such as eth0
			ifconfig eth0 172.16.129.108 netmask 255.255.255.0
		configure gateway
			route add default gw 172.16.129.25
	permanent(for ubuntu)
		vi /etc/network/interfaces
			auto eth0
			iface eth0 inet static
			address 192.168.0.252
			gateway 192.168.0.1
			netmask 255.255.255.0
			#network 192.168.0.0
			#broadcast 192.168.0.255
		restart network
			service network restart 
# route
## check
	route
## add
	sudo route add default gw { gateway IP }
## rm
	sudo route del default gw { gateway IP }
## explanation
- destination
	- target network segment网段 or host主机
	- gateway网关地址 ： * means gateway = network where your host belongs to
	- genmask网关掩码
		- U activate
		- H target is a host
		- G routing to gateway
		- R restore the tabel entries表项 generated by dynamic route
		- D dynamically installed by background program of route
		- M modified by background program by route
		- ! reject route
	- Metric : route distance = the number of intermediate rotations中转 to reach the specified network
	- Ref : route item路由项 reference引用 count
	- Use : the number of times this route item路由项 has been searched by route softwares
	- Iface : the output interface输出接口 corresponding to this route tabel entry 
# check problems
	if "ping 8.8.8.8" 
		failed, then route isn't set properly
		successed, but "ping www.baidu.com" failed, then DNS isn't set properly
	
# ssh
## remote login
> make sure openssh-server has started
	
	if port = 22
		user@ip
	otherwise
		user@ip -p {port}
## openssh-server
	install
		sudo apt-get install openssh-server
	
	check status
		systemctl status ssh
	manually start/stop server
		systemctl start/stop ssh
	autostart/don't autostart server when boot
		systemctl enable/disable ssh
	restart server
		/etc/init.d/ssh restart
	
	configure
		change port
			vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
				uncomment port line, modify it
## transfer file
	rsync (just transfer files)
		remote device to local device
			rsync (-r) username@ip_address:/home/username/file .
		local device to remote device
			rsync (-r) file username@ip_address:/home/username
	sshfs (mount remote directory to local device)
		sshfs username@IP_address:path_to_dir mount_dir
		# don't forget to unmount the directory : umount <dev>
